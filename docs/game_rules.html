    <h1>Math Bowling</h1>
    <h2>Game Rules</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>On a player's turn, a math problem must be answered to initiate a bowling roll.</li>
      <li>A player must answer math problems until filling a frame just like bowling.</li>
      <li>Players must fill all 10 frames just like bowling to finish the game.</li>
      <li>A player has 15 seconds to answer an addition/subtraction problem and 30 seconds to answer a multiplication/division problem.</li>
      <li>If a player does not answer on time, whatever was entered is taken as the answer. If nothing was entered, then the answer is assumed to be 0.</li>
      <li>If an answer is correct, the player gets the equivalent of knocking all remaining pins (a strike for 10, a spare for less than 10).</li>
      <li>If an answer is within the number of remaining pins from the correct answer, then it is considered close. The player gets the equivalent of knocked pins for that answer (e.g. answering 3 or 5 to 2 + 2 gets all remaining pins minus 1). This makes answering the next math problem more challenging just like how the second roll is often more challenging in bowling.</li>
      <li>If an answer is farther from the correct answer than number of remaining pins, then 0 is awarded.</li>
      <li>Players with the highest score at the end win.</li>
      <li>If all players have the same score at the end, it is a tie.</li>
      <li>Players are distinguished by number.</li>
      <li>The game may be played with one player only, in which case it is always that player's turn on every bowling roll (problem answer).</li>
    </ol>
